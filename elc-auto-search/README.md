Hi, Estee Lauder

I downloaded the file and followed the instruction but was unable to run it on my window machine.
So I created my own Node.js/Express server and React Client (bootstrapped by Create-React-App).
However functionality and file structure are almost the same.



### Instruction/Installation

1. Go to root folder where you see 2 folders - 'client' and 'server' and run - `npm install`

2. Go inside of 'client' folder and run - `npm install`

3. go back to root folder and run - `npm start`

This will start a node server first and then open up a React app at `localhost:3000`.

Please start searching product's keywords such as 'Shampoo', 'Reverse', 'Conditioner' ... and press enter to populate on to the page.

Thank you.



### Notable Packages & Libraries

Express, concurrently, Axios, React-Bootstrap
